# React Portfolio

## What is it?
####  This is my professional coding portfolio.  It provides viewers with a list of my various projects with their github and, if available, deployed link.  The Portfolio also includes a copy of my most recent resume, a way to contact me, and a biography.  This page is a continual work in progress as with every project I complete I will incorporate it.
